 * You are developing a biology learning application that 
 * introduces students to the concept of balance in numbers.
As part of an interactive quiz feature, you want to create a 
program that determines if a given number exhibits "Harmony."
Concept:
Harmonious Number: A positive integer N is classified as a 
Harmonious Number if the sum of its first and last digits equals 
the sum of its remaining digits.
Non-Harmonious Number: If the sum of the first and last digits 
does not equal the sum of the remaining digits, the number is 
classified as Non-Harmonious.
Example:
For input number 2468:
First digit and Last digit: 2,8
Remaining digits: 4, 6
Sum of first and last digits = 2 + 8 = 10
Sum of remaining digits = 4 + 6 = 10
Since the sum of first and last digits equals the sum of remaining
digits, 2468 is a Harmonious Number.
Test Case 1: 

	Input  : 1235
	Output : Harmony

Test Case 2: 

	Input  : 2468
	Output : Harmony

Test Case 3: 

	Input  : 9474
	Output : Non-Harmony
